spotify-mp3-downloader
======================

This is a node.js program that is controlled by a web interface. It downloads .mp3 files from Spotify and ID3-tags them accordingly.

**You need a Premium account to use this.**

# How to use:

1. Install Node.js [http://nodejs.org/]
2. Install id3lib
2.1 OS X
`brew install id3lib`

2.2 Other
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/id3lib/files/]

3. Run `node app.js`
This will open your browser (at least on Mac OS X). Otherwise, navigate to [http://localhost:1717].

4. Drag spotify tracks from the Spotify desktop client to the website

# Legal etc.
Spotify prohibits downloading music from their service, so using this tool is not really allowed and you might risk ending up with a suspended account. I am not resposible for any of that :)
